# Predicting Activities from Motion data <br/>
For my project I wanted to try and predict an individuals activity given their motion data. 

# Description of the Data
The subjects are asked to perform the activities in their own style and were not restricted on how the activities should be performed. For this reason, there are inter-subject variations in the speeds and amplitudes of some activities. Each activity is measured over a 5-minute period.

Each subject will wear a total of 45 sensors between their Torso, Right Arm, Left Arm, Right Leg, and Left Leg.
The 45 sensors consist of:
- x, y, z - accelerometers
- x, y, z - gyroscopes
- x, y, z - magnetometers
